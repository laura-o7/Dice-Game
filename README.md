# Dice-Game

This is a digital dice game created using a combination of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

By refreshing the page, the site will automatically roll both dice randomly and display the numbers they land on. This will then display which player won, or whether there was a draw.

The game can be restarted by simply refreshing each time.
